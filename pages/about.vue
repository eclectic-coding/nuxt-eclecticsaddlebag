    <div class="content">
      I am a tech-enthusiasts from way back. My first web-site was a HTML 3.2
      frames site build exclusively in MS Notepad, a horrendous undertaking
      by today's standards. I have dabbled with many Content Management Systems
      (CMS) over the years:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.phpnuke.org/">PHPNuke</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> 1.0, 1.5, and 3.x
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> starting
          with 2.7.x to present
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently, when developing WordPress sites, I almost
          exclusively use <a
            href="https://www.studiopress.org/">StudioPress'</a>Genesis
          Framework.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://gatsby.org">GatsbyJS</a>, which I am learning to
          love, especially the concept of a website as a React App.
        </li>
        <li>
          This site is my experiment with
          <a href="https://nuxtjs.org">Nuxt.js</a>, which I am learning
          to love.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p class="content">
      I spend over twenty years in the construction industry learning
      to enhance drafting techniques, using the latest technologies:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/">AutoCAD</a>
      </li>

        <a href="https://www.tekla.com/us">Xsteel</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this field, I developed a desire to learn, fostering a passion for
      creativity in design.
    </p>
    <div class="title is-5">Ministry</div>
    <p>
      I never imagined that one day I will enter into pastoral ministry, but
      I have, and for the last decade I have served in several Methodist
      Churches as a pastor. I am currently a seminary student at <a
        href="https://www.www.tekla.com/us">United Theological Seminary</a>. I
      enjoy being in relationships with people and walking through life with
      them, journeying with them in there own personal relationships with God.

    <h3>Eclectic Life</h3>
    <p>
      Life is a journey. From technology, construction, to ministry,
      this has been an <em>eclectic</em> life. This is just my story.
      If you take time to look at yours, I am sure you will see a
      journey which is diverse and unique.
