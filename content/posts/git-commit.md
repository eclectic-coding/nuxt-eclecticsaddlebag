As I am sitting at home during this worldwide pandemic, I have been reflecting on this coding journey. I just graduated from [Flatiron School]() and have started the job search. I have pursued technology as a hobbyist for twenty-five years. What in the world possessed me to go back to school at the 58 years old?

### I Need a Web Site
Yep, that is how it started. I was a small business subcontractor in the mid-90's developing fabrication drawings with [AutoCAD]() and needed a web site. My Dad and I attended a Saturday morning workshop hosted by our local Dial-up Internet Serve Provider and learned enough HTML 3.2 to get started.

I learned that I loved to tinker with code, tweak and break code until I figured out what made it work.
